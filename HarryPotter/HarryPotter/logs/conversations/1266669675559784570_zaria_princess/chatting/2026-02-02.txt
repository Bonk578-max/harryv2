[15:19:39] ASSISTANT: Okay, I understand! Thanks for letting me know, Kiddo. So, how are you feeling today? What's on your mind? Maybe you want to talk about something, hear a story, or just chat? I'm happy to listen and be here for you, no matter what. 😊💖 Is there anything specific you'd like to do or talk about?

[15:20:11] USER: You only call me kiddo when I’m in little space
